An in-progress tool to enable users to centrally manage their personal and professional relationships across a variety of social web applications.


Goals for the next month:
	1) import of contacts from various services
	2) automatic consolidation of contacts based on shared identifiers
	3) custom grouping of contacts (with possible group namespaces)
	4) Identifier-based search on other services for people who you are not currently friends with
